Ter takes a folder of markdown files and replicates its structure into a static
site with automatically [indexed](usage/content) directories and backlinks.
[Zettelkasten](zettelkasten)-style.

- see [usage](usage) on how to get started;
- [goals](goals) for some thinking behind Ter's approach;
- or feel free to just roam around.

Made with [Deno](https://deno.land). Deno is fun. Contribute or submit issues:
