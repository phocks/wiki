[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/b566a4/what_is_a_zettelkasten/)
on the r/Zettelkasten subreddit has a great introduction to the system, but
here's a short snippet:

> The term comes from Niklaus Luhmann, a German autodidact and famously prolific
> academic sociologist. Similar techniques were developed independently by
> Nabokov and Prisig, among others.

> Luhmann used a physical box of cards -- imagine an analog library card
> catalog. Most modern practitioners use digital slip-boxes. The core of the
> technique lies in a few simple principles:

> - Write liberally about what you think and read. Write in detail so you can
  > quickly re-internalize ideas after you forget them.
> - Wherever you can, separate notes into small and distinct ideas.
> - When you notice connections between ideas, encode them by writing references
  > from one note to another.
> - When you want to think or write, read your notes and follow the references
  > between them.
